    "**Health insurance** is a contract that covers medical expenses in exchange for an annual fee. It protects you from unexpected medical costs and offers many other benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will consist of using individual customer information (age, BMI, whether they are a smoker, etc.) and the annual cost of their health insurance to obtain a model that can indicate an optimal price for health insurance, given the individual's data. For this, several **supervised machine learning models** will be tested, the one that obtains the lowest error rates will be selected and will go through the finetuning process, in order to improve its prediction.\n",
